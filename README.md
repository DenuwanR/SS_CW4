## Project Overview

This project is a secure message encryption and decryption system that allows users to protect sensitive information. The system provides two main functions: encrypting messages and decrypting them based on user roles (admin and user).

## Features
    User Roles: The system supports different roles such as admin and user to control access.
    Message Encryption: Users can input a message and encrypt it to secure the content.
    Message Decryption: Depending on the user role, encrypted messages can be decrypted to reveal the original content.
    Navigation: The system includes easy navigation with buttons like Home and Logout.
    Visual Feedback: Success notifications and button hover effects enhance user interaction.
    
## Technologies Used
          Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
          Backend: Python (Flask)
          Version Control: Git and GitHub
